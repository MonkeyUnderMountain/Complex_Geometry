\begin{theorem}[Holomorphic implicit function theorem]\label{thm:holomorphic_implicit_function_theorem}
    Let \(f: \bbC^{n+m} \to \bbC^m\) be a holomorphic function. If the Jacobian determinant \(\det(\P f/\P w)\) is nonzero at \((z_0, w_0) \in \bbC^{n+m}\), then there exist open neighborhoods \(U\) of \(z_0\) and \(V\) of \(w_0\), and a unique holomorphic function \(g: U \to V\) such that for any \((z, w) \in U \times V\), \(f(z, w) = f(z_0, w_0)\) if and only if \(w = g(z)\).
